Fitmodel is a software that implements multiple models of molecular sequence evolution in a phylogenetic framework. In particular, it can fit models of substitution between codons, including stochastic branch-site models, to alignments of coding sequences. These models are especially useful for detecting traces of positive (Darwinian) selection during the course of evolution. They can also extract relevant information about the patterns of heterogeneity of selection regimes along sequences and lineages.
